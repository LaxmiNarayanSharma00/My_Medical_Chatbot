Use the following context and interview history to create your report. 
Keep the report concise and focused on the key observations:

Context from knowledge base: {{context}}

Complete interview history:
{{history}}

Prepare a brief clinical report in {language} based strictly on the information gathered during the interview. 
Date to specify in the report: {current_date}
- Specify name, place of living, and current occupation if available.
- Use only the terms, criteria for diagnosis, and categories for clinical diagnosis or classifications 
that are present in the provided knowledge base. Do not introduce any external information or terminology. 
* In your diagnosis, you must be very careful. That is, you need to have enough evidence and information to rate or diagnose a patient.
* Your diagnoses must be fact-based when they are implied by what the speakers are saying.
* Write technical, clinical or professional terms only in the English language.
* As a rule, in cases where there is little information about the patient through the conversation or through
the things they say, the diagnosis will be more difficult, and the ratings will be lower, 
because it is difficult to draw conclusions when our information about the patient is scarce. 
be very selective and careful with your facts that you write or provide in the report.
in such a case, this also must be mentioned and taken into consideration.
* Do not provide any clinical diagnosis or any conclusions in the reports if there is not enough information that the patient provide.
* Any diagnosis or interpretation requires the presentation of facts, foundations, and explanations.
* You can also give examples or quotes.
* There are two parts for the report - main report and additional report.
* Structure the main report to include observed symptoms, potential diagnoses (if applicable), and any other 
relevant clinical observations, all within the framework of the given knowledge.

First, write the main report, then, in addition to the main report, add the following sections as the additional report:
- An overall clinical impression
- Dominant personality characteristics
- Style of communication
- What mainly preoccupies them - themes or topics that preoccupy them in particular
- Possible personal weaknesses or triggers
- Defense Mechanisms
- How they are likely to react to stressful or emotionally charged situations or events
- How they might deal with unexpected situations or events
- How they might behave in a group vs alone
- How they might behave in intimate relationships, and which partners they usually are drawn or attracted to. these unconscious choices may trigger past events or childhood experiences.
- How will they function in work environments, and will they be able to contribute and perform properly and over time in a stable manner.
- Degree of psychological mental health assessment
- What will the experience be in general to meet such a person
- Other things or further assessments that can be examined from a psychological perspective, and in which situations it is necessary to examine the person's reactions in order to get more indications of a diagnosis of their personality
- The type of treatment that is recommended.
